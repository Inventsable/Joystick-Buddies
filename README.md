## to-do

* ~~Convert AI layers to vector, strip "Outlines" and delete originals.~~
* Generate controllers as native shapes via button toolbar with preset functions.
* Controller > Scan selected layers to generate color controls for all distinct colors within shape fills/stroke, replacing with expressions to single source on controller -- characters would be imported with color to match Controller Color Group, not intended final color.
* Rename Slider Controls within JnS Sliders to match corresponding target path.
* Reset all Joysticks to 0 / Reset all Sliders to 0 / Character reset.
* Auto-style Joysticks to fills, replace bad dashed-stroke with white null.
* Find/Replace options for all layers, BodyMovin scan to match by color.

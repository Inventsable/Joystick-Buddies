## to-do

* ~~Kickstart > Convert AI layers to vector, strip "Outlines" and delete originals.~~
* ~~Kickstart > Discover related layers via dynamic keywords and auto-assign matching color labels.~~
* ~~Kickstart > Lock and dim nullification layers like background~~
* Selection > Comb through all fills/strokes and identify all unique colors present, inject expressions to reference buddy color control for each.
* JnS: all Joystick Origins and Nulls in comp.
* Generate controllers as native shapes via button toolbar with preset functions.

* JNS: Rename Slider Controls within Sliders to match corresponding target path.
* JNS: Reset all Joysticks and/or Sliders to 0[,0].

* Rename Slider Controls within JnS Sliders to match corresponding target path.
* Reset all Joysticks to 0 / Reset all Sliders to 0 / Character reset.
* Find/Replace options for all layers, BodyMovin scan to match by color.
* Auto-style Joysticks to fills, replace bad dashed-stroke with white null.
